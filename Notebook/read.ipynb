    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project purpose is to build and end-to-end machine learning product that help a user book a flight. It integrates Azure Cognitive Servies [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) for Natural Language Processsing, Azure Web App for deployemnt, [Azure Application insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) for performance monitoring and [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) for developement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main feature of the chatbot\n",
    "* Welcome card\n",
    "* Detect intention and request features in user request\n",
    "* Ask for missing information\n",
    "* Prompt for confirmation\n",
    "* Booking card simulating flight result\n",
    "* Data validation :  \n",

    "      - check for date coherency  \n",
    "      - detect currency  \n",
    "* Prompt multi-choice if user intent is not detected\n",

    "## Frame Dataset\n",
    "**Presentation** : The dialogues in Frames were collected in a Wizard-of-Oz fashion. Two humans talked to each other via a chat interface. One was playing the role of the user and the other one was playing the role of the conversational agent. We call the latter a wizard as a reference to the Wizard of Oz, the man behind the curtain. The wizards had access to a database of 250+ packages, each composed of a hotel and round-trip flights. We gave users a few constraints for each dialogue and we asked them to find the best deal. This resulted in complex dialogues where a user would often consider different options, compare packages, and progressively build the description of her ideal trip.\n",
